0.4.3:
* Fix unpredictable behavior when both -n and -i or -q are set.
* Make subtitle selection optional (off by default).

0.4.2:
* New switch -c enables autocropping.
* Get rid of .sh suffix for executable scripts.
* Fix long suspected misbehavior due to non deterministic option parsing.
* Add packaging option: publish to ubuntu ppa.

0.4.1:
* Smarter scaling based on a sensible constant for the number of pixels in a
frame of video instead of constant scaling along the width.
* Scaling enforces a target framesize of an even number of 16x16 pixel blocks.
* Make vidstat more resistant to bad input from video files and omit output of
unknown values.

0.4.0:
* Bitrate is now set dynamically based on bpp.
* New dry-run option -D for undvd to examine encoding parameters.
* New tool vidstat to examine video files or dvds.

0.3.3:
* Add option for disabling picture scaling, also clarify this in the userguide.
* undvd no longer needs to write temporary files to /tmp.

0.3.2:
* Fix problem with color output on black-on-white terminals.
* Clarify usage for scandvd.
* Use flag check in ebuild would halt emerge prematurely, fixed.

0.3.1:
* Adding support for vobcopy to clone encrypted dvds. undvd.sh now accepts 
the -u flag to clone a dvd to disk that otherwise doesn't let itself be copied.

0.3.0:
* User set bitrate. Bitrate can now be set implicitly by setting an output 
filesize for the video with the -o switch.
* 2-pass encoding. 2-pass encoding is done automatically if the bitrate is set
below the default. But 1-pass or 2-pass encoding can always be overriden by 
using -1 and -2.
* New option to prevent disc cloning before encoding. The -n switch can now 
be used to skip copying the dvd to the harddrive first, before encoding begins. 
Useful when low on disk space.
* New system sanity check. undvd can now check for all programs it needs by 
supplying the -c switch. It also checks for codec support.

0.2.2:
* New install script. While there was no official way of "installing" undvd 
there is now a makefile with an "install" target, therefore "make install" 
will deploy the files into the filesystem.
* Distribution specific packages:
+ gentoo ebuild
+ ubuntu .deb
+ fedora .rpm
These are all brand new and not well tested.

0.2.1:
Fixed a bug related to the -i switch in undvd. Also added the -i switch in 
scandvd, so they now have the same options for source selection.

0.2.0:
Clarified some of the command line options a bit, added elapsed time. Also 
added a note about the xine playback bug in the user guide.
